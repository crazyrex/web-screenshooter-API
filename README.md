# generic-API-REST
Flask-based API-REST generic solution for Python3.4. 
This example shows the potential of Flask to serve as API-REST framework. 

# Example usage
From the command line:

```bash
python3 -m main.example
```

visit [http://localhost:1050/site-map](http://localhost:1050/site-map) to know the site map of the API-REST.

# Adding multi-threaded processing.

This solution can be mixed with the [parallel-workers example](https://github.com/ipazc/parallel-workers). 
The parallel-workers allows to create parallelized services that can be injected to the controllers.
